Here is a Template Connection System for Members of a Website permitting a easy control and an easy access to the said website. This includes Sign-in and Sign-up pages, system
in order to remember a user when logged-in or to help  user to reinitialie its connection parameters in the case where he/she cannot remember them and more functions! This was
set-up using HTML 5, CSS 3 and PHP as Back-End Language. I hope this could be helpfull to someone having difficulties making this and this was an opportunity for me to test my basic
knowledge of PHP.
